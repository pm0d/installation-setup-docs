# Using a Node Version Manager


There are a lot of different versions of Node out there. These tools
will help you keep track of what version you are using, and also make it
easy to install new versions and switch between them. They also make
npm easier to set up :)

- [OSX, *nix] `nvm`: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- [Windows] `nodist`: https://github.com/nullivex/nodist

### Installing Node.js and npm

#### Using `nvm`

```
nvm install 4
nvm use 4
```

#### Using `nodist`

```
nodist + 4
nodist use 4
```

You can test that it worked by typing:
```
node -v
```
